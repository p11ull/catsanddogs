# Server APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
I wanted to build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I called it cats and dogs as it is a british slang for raining. British weather is almost allways raining.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
 I wanted to see the weather forecast in several cities so that i can plan a trip accordingly.
- What problem does it solve?
When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
  * The city name
  * The date
  * An icon representation of weather conditions
  * The temperature
  * The humidity
  * The wind speed:
- When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
  * The date
  * An icon representation of weather conditions
  * The temperature
  * The humidity
- When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
- What did you learn?
I took the starter code and refactored it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Whenever i got an error message in the console log I had to read and understand the documentation and work out how to resolve the error message.
